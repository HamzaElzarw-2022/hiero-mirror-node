# K6 Performance Tests

This module covers the [k6](https://k6.io/) based performance tests for Mirror Node APIs including rest, rest-java,
rosetta, and web3.

## Setup

The k6 test engine is needed to run the tests. Please follow
the [official documentation](https://k6.io/docs/getting-started/installation/) to install k6. Ensure the following OS
properties are set to avoid resource exhaustion:

```shell
ulimit -n 1048576
echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_tw_reuse
echo "16384 65535" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range
```

## Configuration

Configuration of the k6 tests is done via environment variables. Environment variables can be passed directly to k6 or
placed in an environment file and sourced before each run. For example, here's a `k6.env`:

```shell
export BASE_URL=https://testnet.mirrornode.hedera.com
export DEFAULT_DURATION=1s
export DEFAULT_LIMIT=100
export DEFAULT_VUS=1
```

This file can then be sourced before executing k6:

```shell
source k6.env
```

For non-domain specific parameters like `DEFAULT_DURATION`, `DEFAULT_VUS`, etc. a sane default will be used if not
provided. For domain specific parameters, when the value of a parameter is explicitly set then that value will be used,
otherwise its value will be found by querying the APIs. The `DEFAULT_SETUP_TIMEOUT` controls how much time it should
spend querying for defaults. However, it's strongly recommended to explicitly provide values for all domain specific
parameters to produce consistent results between runs. Some entities have considerably more data than others and
be considerably slower if they're picked and vice versa.

### Common

The following parameters can be used to configure all tests regardless of API:

| Name                  | Default          | Description                                                        |
| --------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| BASE_URL              | http://localhost | The URL prefix without `/api/v1` to connect to                     |
| DEFAULT_DURATION      | 120s             | How much time to execute each test                                 |
| DEFAULT_LIMIT         | 100              | For list APIs, the number of results to return in the response     |
| DEFAULT_SETUP_TIMEOUT | 5m               | The amount of time to discover domain specific defaults            |
| DEFAULT_VUS           | 10               | The number of virtual users k6 should use to parallelize execution |

For k6 to be run we need to deploy the relevant contracts in `test/src/test/resources/solidity` first. For
that, we can use Hedera SDK. Example for ERC_CONTRACT deployment
with js SDK

```js
const contractCreate = await new ContractCreateFlow()
  .setBytecode(
    "HERE YOU NEED TO PUT BYTECODE FROM test/src/test/resources/solidity/artifacts/contracts/ERCTestContract.sol/ERCTestContract.json"
  )
  .setGas(200_000)
  .execute(client);
```

### Filter Test Case

You can use the following test suite specific environment variables to filter the test cases in a suite to run,

- `REST_TEST_EXCLUDE` to exclude test cases in the JS REST test suite
- `REST_TEST_INCLUDE` to include test cases in the JS REST test suite

The value should be a regex string to match lower case test case names. The `exclude` filter has priority over the
`include` filter. Substitute the `REST` prefix with the appropriate suite name for other test suites.

- `REST` for JS REST test suite
- `RESTJAVA` for Java REST test suite
- `ROSETTA` for Rosetta test suite
- `WEB3` for Web3 test suite

Some examples:

- `REST_TEST_EXCLUDE='^transaction.*$'` will exclude all test cases that start with `transaction`
- `REST_TEST_EXCLUDE='^(transaction|topic).*$'` will exclude all test cases that start with either `transaction`
  or `topic`
- `REST_TEST_INCLUDE='^(account|token).*$'` will include only test cases that start with either `account` or `token`

To run a testkube test / testsuite with test case filters, run the following:

```shell
testkube run testsuite test-suite-rest -v REST_TEST_EXCLUDE='^transaction.*$' -v WEB3_TEST_INCLUDE='^.*receive.*$'
```

Note you can pass multiple `-v` flags, one for each filter.

## Execution

The tests are organized per API, and they reside in `src/rest`, `src/rest-java`, `src/rosetta`, and `src/web3`
respectively. The API performance tests can be run as a test suite or individually.

### Test Suite

To run a test suite, such as rest, use the following command:

```shell
source k6.env && k6 run src/rest/apis.js
```

The test suite will run the tests sequentially with a configurable grace period in between tests so that they don't
interfere with each other. Once the tests complete, `k6` will show a test summary. Disregard the per scenario RPS
reported in the `http_reqs` section since it's calculated as the total requests in a scenario divided by the run time of
the test suite.

At the end of a test suite run, a simplified Markdown format `report.md` will be generated. Below is an example
of such a report. The main columns to consider are the `Pass RPS` and the `Avg. Req Duration`.

| Scenario | URL       | VUS  | Pass%  | RPS       | Pass RPS  | Avg. Req Duration | Skipped? | Comment |
| -------- | --------- | ---- | ------ | --------- | --------- | ----------------- | -------- | ------- |
| accounts | /accounts | 1500 | 100.00 | 1390.03/s | 1390.03/s | 351.87ms          | No       |         |
| blocks   | /block    | 1500 | 99.9   | 5571.63/s | 5572.19/s | 300.11ms          | No       |         |

### Single Test

To run a single test, such as the rosetta `accountBalance` test, use a command similar to the below:

```shell
source k6.env && k6 run src/rosetta/test/accountBalance.js
```

When it completes, k6 will show a similar summary report. However, there will not be a report file generated.

### Web3 Tests details:

#### Complex functions

Test complex scenarios by using a single smart contract function.

1. Fungible Token Lifecycle

Source: src/web3/test/complex-functions/contractCallComplexFunctionsTokenLifecycle.js.

This test covers the lifecycle of a fungible token, including: token creation, association, grantKyC, transfer, freeze, unfreeze, pause, unpause, wipe. The test uses `tokenLifecycle(address firstReceiver, address secondReceiver, address treasury)` function from `ComplexFunctions.sol`.

Test Parameters:

- `COMPLEX_FUNCTIONS_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` - contract address for `ComplexFunctions.sol`
- `RECEIVER_ADDRESS` - First account to be used in the test for the transfer. Not associated account
- `SPENDER_ADDRESS` - Second account to be used in the test for the second transfer. Not associated account
- `PAYER_ACCOUNT` - Account to be used as a treasury of the token and for a payer of the transaction. It should have enough balance to pay for the token creation (at least 9.33 Hbars).

2.  Non-Fungible Token Lifecycle

Source: src/web3/test/complex-functions/contractCallComplexFunctionsNFTLifecycle.js.

This test covers the lifecycle of a Non-fungible token, including: token creation, association, grantKyc, mint, transfer, freeze, unfreeze, pause, unpause, wipe. The test uses `nftLifecycle(address firstReceiver, address secondReceiver, address treasury, bytes[] memory metadata)` function from `ComplexFunctions.sol`.

Test Parameters:

- `COMPLEX_FUNCTIONS_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` - contract address for `ComplexFunctions.sol`
- `RECEIVER_ADDRESS` - First account to be used in the test for the transfer. Not associated account
- `SPENDER_ADDRESS` - Second account to be used in the test for the second transfer. Not associated account
- `PAYER_ACCOUNT` - Account to be used as a treasury of the token and for a payer of the transaction. It should have enough balance to pay for the token creation (at least 9.33 Hbars).

### Storage Load Test

This test is designed to stress the EVM storage system by executing a smart contract function that performs thousands of SLOAD operations.
It is useful for benchmarking and performance regression testing of `findStorage` calls.

#### Overview

**Test File:**
`tools/k6/src/web3/test/contractCallEstimateReadStorage.js`

#### Primary Contracts

- **`SlotContract`**: Initializes 600 storage slots in a mapping during construction.
- **`SlotContractCaller`**: The `heavyReadBothHalves()` method calls `readFirstHalf()` and `readSecondHalf()` from `SlotContract` **five times each**,
  resulting in 3,000 total SLOAD operations (600 slots × 5 calls).

#### General Storage Read Stress Test

This test is not limited to a specific contract or method. You can stress-test any smart contract that performs heavy storage reads by updating the following parameters:

- `STORAGE_SLOTS_CONTRACT`: Set this to the **contract address** you want to test.
  **Example:** `0x00000000000000000000000000000000008f005f` (SlotContractCaller)

- `STORAGE_SLOTS_CALLDATA`: Set this to the **method call data** you want to simulate.
  **Example:** `0x523adad6` (`heavyReadBothHalves()` method selector from SlotContractCaller)
